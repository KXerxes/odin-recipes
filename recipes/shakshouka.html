    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshouka is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs. It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It is similar to the Turkish dish 'Menemen' and to the Latin American breakfast dish 'Huevos Rancheros.'</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbps olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 hot chilli pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, bell peppers, and garlic; cook and stir until the vegetables have softened and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and chile pepper into a bowl and mix briefly. Pour the tomato mixture into the skillet, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, until the tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes. Make four indentations in the tomato mixture for the eggs. Crack the eggs into the indentations. Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook until they're firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
